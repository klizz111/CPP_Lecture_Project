Sri Lanka has not paid due attention to the African, Middle East and East Asia markets which have a huge demand for gem and jewellery products, Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Sunil Handunneththi opined addressing the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI) diploma awarding ceremony held at the BMICH.

“We need to take advantage of the high demand for this sector in those markets, as well as make use of the skilled gem and jewellery technicians of our country and the government will take steps to come up with strategic plans to capture that market.”

He also said the government will take measures to convert the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI) into a degree-awarding institute.

Handunneththi said by doing so the country could attract even foreign students and earn forex to the country. He requested the youth in the country to make use of these opportunities. He said the government will provide the necessary financial, technical, expertise and job security to the diploma holders to stay in the trade and become professionals in the Gem and Jewellery sector. He said the diploma holders now should join hands with his ministry to take the sector of gem and jewellery forward.

The Minister also urged the diploma holders to be a part of the professional fraternity working overseas and earning foreign exchange to the country. He said necessary arrangements will be made after discussions with the Ministry Secretary and Deputy Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development to talk to diplomatic missions overseas and try to position the diploma holders upon the requirements of those countries.

The Minister said there is a very high demand for professionals in the gem and jewellery sector in the world and this sector should be developed to the point where local technicians engaged in this sector also get a high demand and value.
